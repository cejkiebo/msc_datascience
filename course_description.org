In the course Data Science for Economics you will learn how to deal with big (unstructured) data to answer policy questions using recent advances in machine learning.

Whether you are a public policy-maker or a data analyst at a private firm,  you might be often tasked with providing answers to inherently causal questions. For example: "What is the optimal pricing and price differentiation scheme for insurance products?" or "Who should receive state benefits?". In such cases you want to use large individual-level data to provide convincing policy prescriptions. However, there are different challenges to it such as obtaining the data, cleaning it, collaborating with your co-workers, and most importantly deciding which (out of many) variables to use in your analysis. 

This course will help you to overcome those challenges. The "traditional" econometrics you have learnt in previous classes provides you with solid knowledge in answering causal questions. Machine learning toolkit, which you will also learn to apply in this class, is primarily targeted to provide the best prediction rather than to answer causal questions. However, when combined together they will help you to work with highly-dimensional datasets, where there are more variables than observations, and you do not know at the start which variables and interaction terms to include. 

In this course, we give an introduction to data-project management  (e.g. git, sublime), tensors (data with more than 2 dimensions), data simulation, neural networks, cross validation. The goal is to get you up to speed with new developments in datascience applicable for economic analysis.

We use data simulation to get the main intuitions across starting from the difference between correlation and causality, the use of instrumental variables and how to deal with heterogeneous treatment effects. We cover the estimation of neural networks using training, test and validation sets, cross-validation and machine learning to find the best instrumental variables.
  
Finally, we will cover post-selection inference for causal effects (as in Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen 2013).
 
In terms of software we will be using python, google's tensorflow, and R. Students must have followed the Econometrics 1 and the python track in AEA 1.
