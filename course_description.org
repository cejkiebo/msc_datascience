In the course Data Science for Economics you will learn how to deal with big (unstructured) data to answer policy questions using recent advances in machine learning.

Whether you are a public policy-maker or a data analyst at a private firm, you might be often tasked with providing answers to inherently causal questions. For example: "What is the optimal pricing and price differentiation scheme for insurance products?" or "Who should receive state benefits?". In a policy context it is often more important to quantify the uncertainty of an effect than to test whether the effect is equal to zero. In such cases you want to use large data to provide convincing policy prescriptions. However, there are different challenges to it such as obtaining the data, cleaning it, collaborating with your co-workers, and most importantly deciding which (out of many) variables to use in your analysis.

This course will help you to overcome those challenges. The "traditional" econometrics you have learned in previous classes provides you with solid knowledge in answering causal questions. Machine learning toolkit, which you will also learn to apply in this class, is primarily targeted to provide the best prediction rather than to answer causal questions.

In this course, we give an introduction to data-project management, tensors (data with more than 2 dimensions), data simulation, neural networks, cross validation. The goal is to get you up to speed with new developments in datascience applicable for economic analysis.

We use data simulation to get the main intuitions across starting from the difference between correlation and causality, the use of instrumental variables and how to deal with heterogeneous treatment effects. We cover the estimation of neural networks using training, test and validation sets and Bayesian estimation techniques.
  
In terms of software we will be using python, pymc3 and google's tensorflow. It is highly recommended that students follow Econometrics 1 and the python track in AEA 1.
